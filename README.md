# Welcome to my Strapi case study! üë®‚Äçüíª

I made this repository as a case study for the utilities and workflow of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), the headless CMS. It goes hand to hand with my other repository [strapi-api](https://github.com/randreu28/strapi-api). 

The idea is to test the limits of having a front-end made with Next.js, which is populated with the data created in my [Admin panel](https://randreu28-strapi-api.herokuapp.com/admin) made with Strapi. 

Feel free to check it out!

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
